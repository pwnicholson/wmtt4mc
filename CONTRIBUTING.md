# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This project is not currently accepting code contributions as a standard workflow.

You can still help by:
- reporting bugs (include steps to reproduce),
- suggesting improvements,
- sharing example Minecraft worlds or edge cases (no copyrighted assets).

If you want to propose a change, open an Issue describing it first.
