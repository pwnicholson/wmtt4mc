# Trademark & Branding Policy (WMTT4MC)

## Project Names
The following are used to identify the official project:
- “World Map Timeline Tool for Minecraft”
- “WMTT4MC”
- Associated logos/icons used in this repository (the “Branding”)

## Official Builds
Only binaries published by Paul Nicholson via this repository’s GitHub Releases are “official.”

## Forks and Derivative Works
Forks are welcome under the applicable license terms, but you must follow these rules:

1) **Do not imply endorsement**
You must not suggest your fork is official or endorsed by Paul Nicholson, Mojang, or Microsoft.

2) **Use a distinct name**
If you distribute a fork publicly (especially binaries), you must use a name that clearly distinguishes it from WMTT4MC (e.g., “<YourName> World Map Timeline Fork”).

3) **Permitted references**
You may say: “Forked from WMTT4MC” and link to the official repo.

4) **No use of official logos**
Do not use the official logo/icon/branding in a way that suggests your fork is the official project.

## Minecraft Disclaimer
If you reference Minecraft in your project description, include a clear disclaimer such as:
“NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Mojang or Microsoft.”
